# About Proof of Vibes
Proof of Vibes otherwise known as Vibes Protocol is an onchain global network of tastemakers delivering verified vibes. Powered by a DAO, a network of tastemakers, vibees, and the general public, we have developed a system for curating experiences, verifying vibes on chain, and verifying people based on positive interactions at in real life experiences (IRL), We then elevate them to tastemakers status & stewards of the culture of the ecosystem.
