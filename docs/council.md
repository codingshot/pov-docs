# Council

## Operating the DAO Dashboard
For council members, there are regular proposals to be approved. For example approving tastemakers, vibees, Issuing Proof of Vibes soul bound Token. 

Anyone is subject to comment on a proposal of the DAO, and that comment is stored on the social.near contract. In order for a quorum to pass, % of the council needs to vote to approve this. For example if the quorum is 51% and there are 3 council members, when 2 members vote the proposal will be automatically executed.

It is important to note for function calls where the DAO is interacting with another smart contract, transactions could still fail. For example, we could propose to mint a Soul bound token but it might fail on the contract level because being a human (via Human SBT) is required for a Proof of Vibe SBT, so once the proposal is voted in on it can still fail. We try to inhibit these
